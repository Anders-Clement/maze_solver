# maze_solver
Small program applying A* to mazes

Requires OpenCV to compile and standard libraries.
Compiled executable is also uploaded, use only if you trust me, an internet stranger, and beware that your antivirus should complain since it is unsigned.

Mazes generated using daedelus: https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm
